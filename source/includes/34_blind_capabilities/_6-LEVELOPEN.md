## level\_open

Integer indicating the open level of the control surface.  Defaults to 1 and must be a higher integer than `level_closed`. This capability is only needed if [`has_level`][1] is set and the value is other than 1. Â For example, if the blind control supports adjustments every 5%, use 20.)

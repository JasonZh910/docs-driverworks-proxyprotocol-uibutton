## Overview

The Intercom Proxy interface is defined in terms of Commands, Requests and Notifications, each of which are described in this section of the proxy and Protocol Guide.

[Intercom Proxy Commands][1] are issued by a proxy consumer and may or may not result in an asynchronous notification in response.  Commands typically change state of the Intercom Proxy, or other components of the intercom architecture.

[Intercom Proxy Requests][2] are issued from a proxy consumer with the expectation of getting a response from the protocol.  Requests do not change state of the intercom proxy or any other component of the architecture.  

[Intercom Proxy Notifications][3] are sent from the intercom proxy to the intercom consumer asynchronously, and indicate a state change in the intercom proxy or one of its related architecture components.

All communication through the proxy interface is asynchronous.  Even request responses, such as getting a list of known intercom devices, are returned asynchronously with respect to the request for that data.

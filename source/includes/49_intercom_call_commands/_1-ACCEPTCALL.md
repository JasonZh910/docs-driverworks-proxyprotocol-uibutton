## ACCEPT\_CALL

The ACCEPT\_CALL command is sent from the Intercom Proxy to the device driver. When the driver receives the ACCEPT\_CALL command, it must handle the command in a manner that enables the device to accept the incoming call. When implemented successfully, receipt of the ACCEPT\_CALL command is followed the [CALL\_ACCEPTED][1] notification being sent from the device driver to the Proxy.


### Signature

`ACCEPT_CALL ()`


Call Flow:

1. A SIP invite to a call is received by the device via the device driver and the device enters a ringing state.
2. The device goes into a state of “incoming call”. 
3. This needs to trigger an Incoming\_Call notification which is sent from the device, via the device driver, to the Proxy.
4. Upon call acceptance, this is followed by the device driver sending a CALL\_ACCEPTED notification to the Proxy.

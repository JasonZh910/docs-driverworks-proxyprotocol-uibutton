## START \_CALL

The START\_CALL command is initiated through Programming or Control/Control in ComposerPro. It is sent to the Intercom Proxy, which then sends a START\_CALL to the device driver. When the driver receives the START\_CALL command, it must handle the command in a manner that enables the device to begin a call. When implemented successfully, receipt of the START\_CALL command is followed by the [CALL\_ACCEPTED][1] notification being sent from the device driver to the Proxy.


### Signature

`START_CALL ()`


Call Flow:

1. Upon receiving a START\_CALL command from the Proxy, a SIP invite is generated.
2. The SIP invite to a call is received by the device via the device driver and the device enters a ringing state.
3. The device goes into a state of “outgoing call”. 
4. This needs to trigger an [Outgoing\_Call][2] notification which is sent from the device, via the device driver, to the Proxy.
5. Upon call acceptance, this is followed by the device driver that receives the call, sending a CALL\_ACCEPTED notification to the Proxy.

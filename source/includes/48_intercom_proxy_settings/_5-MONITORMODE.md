## Monitor Mode

This setting is used to control whether or not an intercom endpoint is in monitor mode; a monitor mode call works like a baby monitor; it will quietly auto answer the incoming call on the receiver's (monitored) endpoint, the initiator's (monitoring) endpoint is automatically muted so that there is no transmission of sound to the monitored endpoint. The initiator can un-mute the call anytime two way communications are needed. Endpoints with monitor enabled will not receive broadcast calls, even if they are specified in the call group used for the broadcast.

Monitor mode also has a feature that allows the call to be taken over by different endpoint without having to end the original call. This feature is allows the user to continue to monitor a particular endpoint as they move from one room to another.

## button \_bar and Driver XML

To designate which transport control buttons appear on the Button Bar, the transports capabilities XML needs to include a  `<button_bar></button_bar` tag. 

Within the button bar XML is a `<buttons></buttons>` tag. This tag contains the buttons that will display in the button bar. Each button is defined further in the XML with a `<button></button>` tag that includes an id, name, command, type. 

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| id | Identification used for the button. For example: PLAY. This id value is important as it used by a corresponding Proxy Variable to identify this button. |
| name | Name used for the button. For example: Play. This text will be displayed in the button if no alternative icon is defined. |
| command | The command that is sent to the Room or Proxy. For example: PLAY. |
| type | Whether the command is sent to the Room or the Proxy. Values include ROOM or PROXY. |

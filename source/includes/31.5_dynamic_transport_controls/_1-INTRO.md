## Introduction

Beginning with O.S. 3.2.3, AV drivers have the ability to define which transport controls are displayed on Navigators. This includes which buttons appear on the Button Bar as well as the Media Dashboard. 

This enhancement allows for the appropriate transport controls being displayed for each AV device. This is accomplished using the driverâ€™s Capabilities, Variables and several Proxy Commands.

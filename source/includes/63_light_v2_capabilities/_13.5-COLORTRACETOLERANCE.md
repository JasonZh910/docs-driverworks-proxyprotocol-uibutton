## color\_trace\_tolerance

Some color lighting hardware or communication protocols lack enough bits or precision to set all possible colors, especially if using 8 bit Mired, RGB, or HSV values. This capability adjusts the CIELa*b* Delta comparison value to allow drivers to increase or reduce the color comparison area to work around rounding issues in devices and/or communication. Most people can visually detect a color difference with a Delta of 3.0 or higher. Control4 has chosen a default Delta of 1.0 as this should be sufficient for most hardware and protocols.

This Delta value is used by the system to determine if two colors are close enough to be considered "the same". This tolerance check is used by Advanced Lighting Scenes, Composer Programming, and other areas.

In 3.3.1 and later releases, if the Delta value provided is \> .01, then the superior CIELa*b* tolerance formula is used to determining if a color is the as another color in the system. If the value provided is \< .01, or any value in 3.3.0, then the difference is based on the xy  chromaticity euclid distance between two colors.

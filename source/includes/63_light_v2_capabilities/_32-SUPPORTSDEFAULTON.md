## supports\_default\_on

_Note: Deprecating - Drivers should not use this capability but instead use the brightness on mode preset capability Drivers that enable both will experience oddities in Composer dealer configuration._

This feature is for lights that support a default ON brightness in their firmware. When enabled, the Light Proxy sends a SET\_PRESET\_LEVEL command to drivers when the brightness "On‚Äù preset is updated in the proxy through Composer or the PRESET\_LEVEL system variable. This enables light switches that respond to local button presses to go to the same default ON level as what the Control4 system uses when a light is turned on or toggled via Navigators, Composer Programming, and keypad buttons.

## brightness\_on mode\_preset

Used to enable generic brightness presets to be used with the "On Mode" behavior.  If a driver supports this capability, it is up to the driver to support additional parameter handling and reporting.

See SET\_BRIGHTNESS\_TARGET, BRIGHTNESS\_CHANGING and BRIGHTNESS\_CHANGED commands and notifies and look for optional parameters such as LIGHT\_BRIGHTNESS\_TARGET\_PRESET\_ID and LIGHT\_COLOR\_CURRENT\_PRESET\_ID.

Additionally, drivers need to implement UPDATE\_BRIGHTNESS\_ON\_MODE and UPDATE\_BRIGHTNESS\_PRESET commands so they can track values for situations where the proxy is not the initiator of light behavior, such as On Mode Fade, scenes, composer programming, etc.

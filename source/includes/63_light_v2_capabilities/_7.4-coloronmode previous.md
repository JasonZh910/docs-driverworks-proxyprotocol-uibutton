## color\_on\_mode\_previous


Used to enable the Previous Color On "On Mode" behavior for a light. The 3.3.2 and newer proxies track the last color reported by a driver before a BRIGHTNESS\_CHANGED notification occurs with a level of 0. When the proxy gets a generic On (aka Dynamic On) then the proxy will send a SET\_COLOR\_TARGET command with that last reported color before the brightness went to 0. The proxy will also update the PREVIOUS color preset value with the last color prior to the proxy receiving a BRIGHTNESS\_CHANGED notify of a value of 0.

Additionally if drivers get a command to turn on that did not come from the proxy, the driver can check the PREVIOUS color preset value to know what color it should turn on to.

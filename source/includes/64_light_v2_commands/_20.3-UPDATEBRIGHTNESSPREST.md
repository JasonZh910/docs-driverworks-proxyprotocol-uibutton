## UPDATE\_BRIGHTNESS\_PRESET

The proxy will send a command to the driver when a Preset is changed. Drivers can ignore this command, or could react based on the data provided. 

Some options for reacting to the command would be to update keypad load control firmware to turn a light On to the level that the light was turned off from. 

Another reaction could be to adjust what light level the light will turn on to, such as interacting with the Daylight Agent.

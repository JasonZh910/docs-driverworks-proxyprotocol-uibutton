## UPDATE\_BRIGHTNESS\_ON\_MODE

Drivers that set either brightness\_on\_mode\_preset or brightness\_on\_mode\_previous capabilities to true need to handle this command to know how the light should turn on. The proxy will handle Brightness related commands that go through it, but On behaviors that include BUTTON\_LINK and other driver commands handled only in the driver should honor the On Mode.

## DYNAMIC\_ON
This command allows UI's and programming to "turn on" a light involving both brightness and color in a single command. Beginning with O.S. 3.3.2, Navigators now execute DYNAMIC ON when a light is turned on/off. If a driver does not support Dynamic On, the On brightness preset will be executed, as in O.S 3.3.1 and prior releases.

## BUTTON\_ACTION

Used to perform a button action on the device via BUTTON\_LINK bindings. This is useful if you want to do user dependent hold/release functionality in a driver or hardware. Proxy will create and maintain the consumer binding connections for TOP, BOTTOM and TOGGLE lightV2 buttons and their BUTTON\_LINK bindings. When the proxy gets a BUTTON\_ACTION command over one of the three binding connections, it will forward the command to the driver. The driver needs to send a BUTTON\_ACTION Notify back to the proxy with the same BUTTON\_ID and ACTION params and values so the proxy knows the command was successful and that the driver or hardware is tracking that the button is currently in a Pressed state.Â \_

If a driver does not do send the Notify that a button is Pressed to the proxy, an additional (second) Press command will be auto-generated by the proxy and sent to the driver if the proxy receives a Click and has not been notified that the drivers button is in a Pressed state.

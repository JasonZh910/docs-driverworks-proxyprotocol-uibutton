## UPDATE\_COLOR\_ON\_MODE

Drivers that set either color\_on\_mode\_preset, color\_on\_mode\_previous, or color\_on\_mode\_fade capabilities to true need to handle this command to know how the light should turn on. The proxy will handle Color related commands that go through it, but On behaviors that include BUTTON\_LINK and other driver commands handled only in the driver should honor the On Mode.

For drivers that support Color Fade on mode, Dynamic On and some other commands will NOT send a SET\_COLOR\_TARGET. Drivers that are currently in the Color Fade on mode must adjust the color based on the brightness level when only brightness is sent. For more information see the Color Fade On Mode capability documentation.

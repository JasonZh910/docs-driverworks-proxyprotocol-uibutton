### supports\_multichannel\_scenes

Causes the LightV2 proxy to send the "EXECUTE\_SCENE" command to the device rather than a set level command. If supports\_broadcast\_scenes and supports\_multicast\_scenes are both false, the light V2 proxy will send a SYNC\_SCENES command to the Protocol Driver with TIME and STATE parameters, when the device comes online.

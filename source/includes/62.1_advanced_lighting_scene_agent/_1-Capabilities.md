## Capabilities

Capabilities provide a way for protocol driver to tell an agent what functionality the driver and/or hardware has. Capabilities need to be defined in the drivers c4i or c4z configuration file or updated via a Dynamic Capabilities Changed Notify. 

Only capacities that are different from the defaults need to be specified.

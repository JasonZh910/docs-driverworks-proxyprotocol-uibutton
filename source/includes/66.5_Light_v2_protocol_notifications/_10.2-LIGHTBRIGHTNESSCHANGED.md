## LIGHT\_BRIGHTNESS\_CHANGED

Part of the new Level Target API, used to notify the proxy that a lights brightness changed.  It is not required to send a LIGHT\_BRIGHTNESS\_CHANGING Notify before sending this, so devices like switches or some dimmers that do not provide status on where they are going can still be implemented with the new API. This notify should always be sent to the proxy when the driver starts and/or when the hardware comes online and the driver knows the actual brightness of the hardware.

| LIGHT BRIGHTNESS CURRENT           | DOUBE | Double. Raw value of where the light brightness stopped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| LIGHT BRIGHTNESS CURRENT PRESET ID | INT   | Integer. Optional. This should only be included if presets levels are defined and the level is equal to the preset. Providing this will allow the proxy to track and update the drivers level if the preset level is modified. This is needed for drivers making use of the Daylight Agent or similar features. |


### Returns

`None`


### Usage Note

Dimmer Drivers should only use BRIGHTNESS\_CHANGING and BRIGHTNESS\_CHANGED notifies and no longer use LEVEL\_CHANGE notify.

Switch drivers only need to use the BRIGHTNESS\_CHANGED notify.

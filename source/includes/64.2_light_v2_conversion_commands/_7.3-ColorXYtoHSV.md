## ColorXYtoHSV
This function converts a CIE-1931 xy chromaticity to the HSV color space. Note, there's no need for a driver developer to specify whitepoint and primaries if usinh srgb or rec2020 for the gamut parameter as described below.


_This function was released in conjunction with O.S. 3.3.0._


### Signature

`C4:ColorXYtoHSV (x, y, gamut)`


### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| num | Number representing the x component of a CIE-1931 xy chromaticity.|
| num | Number representing the y component of a CIE-1931 xy chromaticity. |
| str | (Optional) Gamut used for conversion. Valid options are: "srgb" where the srgb primaries and whitepoint values are automatically used without requiring the primaries and whitepoint parameters being set. "rec2020" where where the rec2020 primaries and whitepoint values are automatically used without requiring the primaries and whitepoint parameters being set. “custom” where primaries and whitepoint values can be specified. |


### Returns

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| num | Number representing the hue component of HSV. |
| num | Number representing the saturation component of HSV. | 
| num | Number representing the value component of HSV. |


### Examples
```xml
—Using three rgb params:—
C4:ColorXYtoHSV(0, 100, 100)
—Since no scale param is supported, the default of "255" is used for the scale value param.—

— Using srgb primaries and whitepoint: —
C4:ColorXYtoHSV(0, 100, 100, \"srgb\")
—Since no scale param is supported, the default of "255" is used for the scale value param.—

— Using rec2020 primaries and whitepoint: —
C4:ColorXYtoHSV(0, 100, 100, \"rec2020\")
—Since no scale param is supported, the default of "255" is used for the scale value param.—

— Using custom gamut where custom primaries and the 'default' d65 whitepoint is used: —
C4:ColorXYtoHSV(0, 100, 100, \"custom\", \"0.7,0.25,0.25,0.75,0.1,0.5\")

—Using custom gamut with both custom primaries and custom whitepoint is specified:—
C4:ColorXYtoHSV(0, 100, 100, \"custom\", \"0.7,0.25,0.25,0.75,0.1,0.5\", \"0.31271, 0.32902\")

—Using Rob params but specifying a custom rgb scale. Scale is 0.0 to 1.0 where 1.0 is full brightness: —
C4:ColorXYtoHSV(0, 100, 100, 1)

— Scale is 0.0 to 100 where 100 is full brightness: —
C4:ColorXYtoHSV(0, 100, 100, 100)

— Scale is 0.0 to 255 where 255 is full brightness: —
C4:ColorXYtoHSV(0, 100, 100, 255)

— Using srgb primaries & whitepoint: —
C4:ColorXYtoHSV(0, 100, 100, 255, \"srgb\")

— Using rec2020 primaries/whitepoint: —
C4:ColorXYtoHSV(0, 100, 100, 255, \"rec2020\")

— Custom gamut where custom primaries and the 'default' d65 whitepoint is used: —
C4:ColorXYtoHSV(0, 100, 100, 255, \"custom\", \"0.7,0.25,0.25,0.75,0.1,0.5\")

— Custom gamut with both custom primaries and custom whitepoint is specified: —
C4:ColorXYtoHSV(0, 100, 100, \"custom\", \"0.7,0.25,0.25,0.75,0.1,0.5\", \"0.31271, 0.32902\"
```

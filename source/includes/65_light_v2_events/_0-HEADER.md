**Keypad Events**

An event is fired when something happens to one of the buttons on the device. The pattern for determining the Event ID is: 

5001 + action + (btnID \*Â 5). 

The actions are:

- Release = 0
- Push = 1
- Single Click = 2
- Double Click = 3
- Triple Click = 4

The button IDs are determined by the protocol driver, but the standard ordering is:

- Top = 0
- Bottom = 1
- Toggle = 2

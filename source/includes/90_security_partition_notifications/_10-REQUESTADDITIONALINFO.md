If the flag is true, then each character will show up on the Navigator screen as a dot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| INTERFACE ID  | BOOL | Commands received from Director will have an interface\\\_id string sent as one of the parameters.  This is a unique string that identifies where the command originated. When a response such as a failure is sent, it should only display on the UI that originated the command.  To support this, the INTERFACE ID string is sent back with the notification. Only the original UI will show the results of this notification. |

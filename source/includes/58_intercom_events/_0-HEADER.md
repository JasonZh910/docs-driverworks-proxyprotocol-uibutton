# Intercom Events

Intercom Events are tied to programming in ComposerPro. Events are also [recored in history][1] and can be used to trigger notifications using the History Agent.

For example, itâ€™ possible to trigger a notification on a mobile phone based on an incoming call (Incoming Call Event) that occurs on a door station or any other device in the project that uses the Intercom Proxy.

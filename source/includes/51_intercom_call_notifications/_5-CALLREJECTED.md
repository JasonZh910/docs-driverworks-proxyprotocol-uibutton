## CALL\_REJECTED

The CALL\_REJECTED notification is generated by the device driver and sent to the intercom proxy when a call is rejected.


### Signature

`CALL_REJECTED ()`


Call Flow:

1. A SIP invite to a call is received by the device via the device driver and the device enters a ringing state. 
2. The device goes into a state of “incoming call”. 
3. Upon entering this state, the device driver needs to trigger an [INCOMING\_CALL][1] notification which is sent from the device to the intercom proxy.
4. Upon answering the call, the CALL\_REJECTED notification is sent to the intercom proxy indicating that the device did not answer the call.



| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| num | The Device ID of the Proxy. |
| str | The Session ID of the SIP session. Session ID is established when a call is initiated and serves as a unique identifier of the call. | 
| num | Hang up type: 0 = LOCAL, 1 = REMOTE, 2 = BCASTEMPTY, 3 = NOTFOUND, 4 = DEVBUSY, 5 = NOANSWER, 6 = HUNKOWN |  


### Returns

`None`


### Usage Notes:

The CALL\_REJECTED notification is only applicable to devices that are NOT active in a call session. For example, in the case of a group call, the CALL\_REJECTED notify is sent only by the device or devices that did not participate in the call. Other devices in the call list that answered the call,  should sent a [CALL\_ENDED][2] to the proxy.
